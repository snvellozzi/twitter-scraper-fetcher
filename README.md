# Twitter Scraper Fetcher: MLH Python Workshop

This web app takes the user's message and a person's Twitter handle and uses the Twitter API to request 10,000 tweets from the person. The Flask Python library is used to handle requests and responses. Lastly, the app uses scraping and formatting techniques to clean the tweets and pass the information to the Markovify library (maintained by GitHub user jsvine) to generate appropriate responses.
